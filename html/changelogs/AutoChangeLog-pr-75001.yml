changes:
  - refactor: "Spiderlings are now basic mobs, report any complete weirdness/deviation from known behavior. They should be a lot more intelligent now though."
  - rscadd: "AI Spiderlings are super fragile, but they're also super fast, especially when they get into a vent. Once they're in circulation, they could end up everywhere! Maybe in the armory, maybe in a locked closet in maintenance. Be sure to be vigilant and splat them whenever you can to save the station from a whole lotta heartache!"
